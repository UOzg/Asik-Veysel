      <p><strong>Asik Veysel</strong> (born Veysel Satiroglu; 25 October 1894 � 21 March 1973) was a Turkish ashik and highly regarded poet of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_folk_literature" target="_blank">Turkish folk literature</a>. He was born in the Sivrialan village of the Sarkisla district, in the province of Sivas. He was an ashik, poet, songwriter, and a baglama virtuoso, the prominent representative of the Anatolian ashik tradition in the 20th century. He was blind for most of his lifetime. His songs are usually sad tunes, often dealing with the inevitability of death. However, Veysel used a wide range of themes for his lyrics; based on morals, values, and constant questioning on issues such as love, care, beliefs, and how he saw the world as a blind man.</p>

          <h3>Early life</h3>
          <p>Smallpox was prevalent throughout the Ottoman region that included Sivas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His mother Gulizar and his father Ahmet had already lost two daughters to smallpox before Veysel was born. When Veysel turned seven in 1901, another smallpox outbreak occurred in Sivas, and Veysel contracted the disease as well. He became blind in his left eye and a cataract developed in his right eye. After an accident, his right eye was blinded as well. His father gave his blind son a baglama and recited many folk poems to him. Poets of the region also started to drop by Ahmet Satiroglu�s house as well with their friends. They played instruments and sang songs. Veysel used to listen to them carefully.</p>

            <h4>Veysel, the child baglama player</h4>
            <p>Veysel devoted himself wholeheartedly to playing baglama and singing. He was first instructed by his father's friend, �amisihli Ali Aga (�sik Al�), who taught him about the works of Pir Sultan Abdal, Karacaoglan, Dertli, R�hsati and other great Alevi poets and ashiks of Anatolia.</p>

          <h3>World War I and after</h3>
          <p>Veysel was 20 when the First World War started. All of his friends and his brother rushed to the front, but because of his blindness he was left alone with his baglama.</p>
  
          <p>After the war, he married a woman named Esma, who bore him a daughter and a son. The son died 10 days after birth. On 24 February 1921 Veysel's mother died, followed eighteen months later by his father. By then Esma had left him and their six-month-old daughter, running off with a servant from his brother's house. His daughter also died at a young age.</p>
